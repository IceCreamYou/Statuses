Submodules should generally be named statuses_[integrated_module]. The reason
most of them are not named this way is because they existed before Statuses was
renamed, and it's not worth the hassle of renaming them when the machine name
isn't user-facing anyway. "FBSS" previously stood for "Facebook-style Statuses"
which was the name of this module in Drupal 6 and earlier. The module was
renamed because it has evolved from merely imitating Facebook alone to a more
generally useful suite of communication tools.
